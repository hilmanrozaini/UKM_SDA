I'm not a stranger to the dark
"Hide away, they say"
'Cause we don't want your broken parts
I've learned to be ashamed of all my scars
"Run away, they say"
No one will love you as you are

But I won't let them break me down to dust
I know that there's a place for us
For we are glorious

When the sharpest words wanna cut me down
"I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown them out"
"I am brave, I am bruised"
"I am who I'm meant to be, this is me"
Look out 'cause here I come
And I'm marching on to the beat I drum
I'm not scared to be seen
"I make no apologies, this is me"

Another round of bullets hits my skin
"Well, fire away 'cause today, I won't let the shame sink in"
We are bursting through the barricades
And reaching for the sun (we are warriors)
"Yeah, that's what we've become"

Won't let them break me down to dust
I know that there's a place for us
For we are glorious

When the sharpest words wanna cut me down
"Gonna send a flood, gonna drown them out"
"I am brave, I am bruised"
"I am who I'm meant to be, this is me"
Look out 'cause here I come
And I'm marching on to the beat I drum
I'm not scared to be seen
"I make no apologies, this is me"

This is me

And I know that I deserve your love
There's nothing I'm not worthy of
When the sharpest words wanna cut me down
"I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown them out"
"This is brave, this is bruised"
"This is who I'm meant to be, this is me"

Look out 'cause here I come (look out 'cause here I come)
"And I'm marching on to the beat I drum (marching on, marching, marching on)"
I'm not scared to be seen
"I make no apologies, this is me"

(Whenever the words wanna cut me down
I'll send the flood to drown them out)
"I'm gonna send the flood, gonna drown them out"

This is me
