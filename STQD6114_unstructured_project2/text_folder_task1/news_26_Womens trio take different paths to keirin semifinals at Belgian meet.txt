Women's trio take different paths to keirin semi-finals at Belgian meet

KUALA LUMPUR: All three national riders made it to the semi-finals in the women's keirin at the International Belgian Track Meet (IBTM) in Ghent yesterday.

Anis Amira Rosidi, the most senior among the trio, secured a direct spot in the semi-finals after winning her opening round heat at the Eddy Merckx Flemish Cycling Center.

Nurul Izzah Izzati Mohd Asri and Nurul Aliana Syafika Azizan, however, both placed second in their opening round heats and were forced to go the repechage route.
The duo, however, rose to the occasion and won their respective repechage heats to join Anis in the semi-finals.
Anis placed fourth in her semi-final heat which was won by Taky Marie Divine Kouame (Creteil-Kronos) with Giada Capobianchi (Italy) and Oleksandra Lohviniuk (Ukraine) coming in second and third.


Izzah and Aliana, who were grouped together in the other semi-final heat, placed fourth and sixth respectively.
Julie Michaux (Creteil-Kronos) won the heat ahead of Anna Jabornikova (Czech Republic) and Nicky Degrendele (Belgium), who were second and third. Only the top-three from each heat progressed to the main final.

Anis took some consolation as she later won the 7-12th position final ahead of second placed Margaret Iona (Team Inspired). Izzah came in third while Aliana was sixth.

Taky Marie went on to win the gold medal with Nicky and Oleksandra claiming silver and bronze in the main final.

Azizulhasni Awang, Shah Firdaus Sahrom, Fadhil Zonis and Ridwan Sahrom are scheduled to compete in the men's keirin later today.
