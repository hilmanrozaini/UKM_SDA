Marissa creates history for Malaysian artistic gymnastics

KUALA LUMPUR: Marissa Zaiful Azlan is Malaysia's new darling in artistic gymnastics following her exploits at the Asian Junior Championships in Singapore.

Rising star Marissa created history by winning Malaysia's first medal in an Asian-level competition.

She won the vault bronze medal at the Singapore Sports Hub OCBC Arena on Monday.

The 15-year-old amassed 12.750 points to finish behind winner Amber Ward of Hong Kong (13.066 points) and silver medallist Umemoto Sawa of Japan (12.850).

Compatriot Hannah Yasmeen Mazwan missed the bronze medal after scoring 12.443 points to finish fourth in the balance beam event.


In the boys' competition, Marvell Vincent Woo was Malaysia's best performer when he finished sixth in the high bar event. Malaysia need a new superstar gymnast following the retirement of Farah Ann Abdul Hadi in March last year, and Marissa will likely step in as the new star in the sport.

Coach Nataliya Sinkova is delighted with the progress of her gymnasts.

"I have been working in Malaysia for the last 25 years, and the bronze is definitely the nation's first Asian-level medal, be it senior or junior," said Sinkova today.

"The medal will definitely force other countries to take notice of our progress. We will soon stand together with traditional powerhouses Japan, South Korea and China. Sinkova said her charges' performances augur well for Malaysia after the retirements of Olympian Farah Ann Abdul Hadi, Tan Ing Yueh and Tracie Ang.

"The current juniors have a promising future. "Marissa started training with us when she was 10. She is strong in jumping, vaulting and floor exercises.

"Hannah has been under my guidance since she was four years old. She is now 14. The gymnast was unlucky not to win a medal in Singapore.

"Hopefully, my girls will blossom into great gymnasts in the future," she added.
