Record breaker Anis aims to build on progress

KUALA LUMPUR: National track cyclist Anis Amira Rosidi is looking forward to a strong season ahead after capping her year on a high note.

The 25-year-old set a new national record in the 200m sprint (sea level) by clocking 11.094 seconds en route to gold at the MNCF Presidents Cup which was held at the National Velodrome in Nilai on Dec 8.

The previous national mark of 11.08s had been set by the now-retired Fatehah Mustapa at the 2015 World Championships in Paris.
Anis had earlier this season won gold in the individual sprint and bronze in the keirin at the Track Asia Cup 1 which was held in Thailand in August.
The Perlis-born rider said breaking the record has given her added motivation in her bid to qualify for the 2024 Paris Olympics.


"I had been aiming to break the record for some time so I am very happy to have finally achieved it," said Anis.
"I hope I can continue with this momentum next year. There will be a lot of competitions next season and I need to win.

"My goal is to keep improving and continue to lower my times. I will follow the advice of my coaches.

"I feel that I need more competitions to improve on my race tactics, I feel that this is an area which I am lacking at the moment."

Anis had been active in track and field earlier in her career but picked up cycling after tearing her hamstring in 2013.

She will next compete in the UCI Nations Cup series which will be held over three legs beginning with Jakarta (Feb 23-26) followed by rounds in Cairo (March 14-17) and Milton (March 20-23). The series offers valuable UCI ranking points.
