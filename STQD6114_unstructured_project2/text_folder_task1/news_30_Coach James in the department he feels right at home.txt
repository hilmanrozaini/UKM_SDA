Coach James in the department he feels right at home

PETALING JAYA: James Chua (pic) finds it easier to get into the swing of things as a men’s singles coach.

The former Malaysian Open winner, who joined the Badminton Association of Malaysia (BAM) last July, ended his stint as the women’s singles coach before the SEA Games in Cambodia last month.
James believes that he can beef up the department by leveraging his experience as a former men’s singles shuttler.

“So far, everything has gone well,” said James.

“I used to be a men’s singles player and now I’m back in the department as a coach.
“So I think it’ll take me lesser time to adjust to the role because I can use my previous training methods and regime, which is beneficial for the players.

“Girls have a different style of playing, so the training routines and programmes are different.

“I think coaching boys suits me better because they have higher self-expectation, as well as stronger competitiveness and desire to win.

“Whatever new things that I teach them, they are willing and eager to give it a shot.”

Even when he was coaching the girls, James kept an eye on the progress of the men’s singles department, so it didn’t take long for him to identify the areas that needed to be improved.

“All this while, the men’s and women’s singles players trained on the next courts at the same time,” said James.

“Our boys have all the talent, techniques and skills to succeed.

“We need to put in more effort now to analyse their playing styles and find ways to overcome their weaknesses while further strengthening their strengths.

“The main aspect that needs to be improved is their mental strength, so we will start with improving their physical first.

“As their physical condition improves, so will the strength of their minds.”
