No stars, no problem for Harimau Malaya in AFF Cup

KUALA LUMPUR: Will lightning strike twice for Malaysia in the AFF Cup when they take on Myanmar in their Group B opener at the Thuwunna Stadium in Yangon tomorrow?

In 2016, Harimau Malaya lost 1-0 in Yangon to Myanmar in an AFF Cup match and failed to reach the semi-finals.

Six years on, a new-look Malaysia, without their big stars, hope to beat Myanmar in their own backyard.
Although Malaysia will be without big names from Johor Darul Ta'zim, KL City and Sri Pahang, national coach Kim Pan Gon is confident his team will do well against Myanmar.
"I am unperturbed by the 2016 result. We are well-prepared for the tournament, and my boys are hungry for success," said Pan Gon in Yangon today.


Myanmar will hold almost no advantage playing at home as only 2,000 fans will be allowed into the
32,000-capacity Thuwunna Stadium.

"My players are fit and confident. We will try and get the best results in the AFF Cup.

"Away games are always very tough. Myanmar are a good team. Their players are skillful and play attractive football, but we should not focus on them.

"I selected the best available players for this tournament. I am very happy with their progress and commitment," the South Korean added.

Malaysia, which has qualified for next year's Asian Cup, defeated Cambodia (4-0) and the Maldives (3-0) in warm-up matches ahead of the AFF Cup.
