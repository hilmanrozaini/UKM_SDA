Malaysia crush Kazakhstan 7-0 in Kakamigahara

KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia claimed the fifth spot in Asia when they hammered Kazakhstan 7-0 in hockey's Junior Asia Cup in Kakamigahara, Japan, today.

Malaysia had a slow start, as Kazakhstan defended well under a steady drizzle, but when Azmyra Mia Sofea scored off a well-planned attack in the 14th minute, the floodgates opened.

Malaysia's other goals were scored by Dian Nursyakira Najwa (18th), Nur Shamine Azureen (28th), Dian Nursyakira Najwa (36th), Azmyra Mia Sofea (44th), Nur Shamine Azureen (53rd) and Siti Nur Irdina (55th).

After Malaysia's 3-1 loss to South Korea in Group A, the team had to play in the fifth-eighth classification while the Koreans went all the way to the final to battle India for the gold.

"The 7-0 scoreline is quite flattering because Kazakhstan is not an easy team to play against. We had planned hard for this match and my girls played their roles well in every department to claim the fifth spot in Asia.


"These players have good potential and I believe that with more exposure, they can become better. For many of them, the JAC was their first international tournament," said coach Lailin Abu Hassan.
