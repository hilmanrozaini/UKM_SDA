Yew Sin-Ee Yi the only survivors on tough opening day for Malaysia

PETALING JAYA: Ong Yew Sin-Teo Ee Yi survived a scare to advance to the second round of the Indonesian Open on a day when all other Malaysians fell by the wayside.
The independent men’s doubles pair had to come from behind to overcome India’s M.R. Arjun-Dhruv Kapila 12-21, 21-6, 22-20 in the first round at the Istora Senayan Stadium in Jakarta yesterday.
World No. 7 Yew Sin-Ee Yi had an opportunity to win when leading 20-19 in the third game but the tenacious Indian pair saved the match point.
The former, however, managed to stay composed and took their next opportunity at 21-20 to win the match and preserve their unbeaten record against world No. 24 Arjun and Dhruv.
Yew Sin-Ee Yi will face a tricky task next against home pair and world No. 10 Leo Rolly-Daniel Marthin.
Meanwhile, in the men’s singles, Ng Tze Yong went down fighting 7-21, 21-17, 13-21 to China’s world No. 6 Shi Yuqi.
It was the first meeting between the two in international events and world No. 21 Tze Yong did well to come back and win the second game after losing the first easily.But the 23-year-old’s hopes of pulling off a major upset were dashed as Yuqi used his experience to come away with the win.
“I found it hard to control the first game,” lamented Tze Yong.
“I was also quite far behind in the first game and grew nervous when I couldn’t win points.”
Another representative in the men’s singles, independent player Lee Zii Jia will open his campaign today against India’s 2022 Birmingham Commonwealth Games champion Lakshya Sen.
In the women’s singles, Goh Jin Wei crashed out after losing 11-21, 11-21 to former three-time world champion and 2016 Rio Olympics gold medallist Carolina Marin of Spain.
There was also disappointment in the mixed doubles when both Goh Soon Huat-Shevon Lai Jemie and Chen Tang Jie-Toh Ee Wei saw their campaigns come to premature ends.
World No. 8 Soon Huat-Shevon led 20-17 in the second game and should have won but squandered their match points to lose 21-13, 24-26, 17-21 to home favourites Rehan Naufal-Lisa Ayu (No. 12).
Tang Jie-Ee Wei, who reached a career-high No. 17 in the latest world rankings, could not celebrate their rise when they lost out 17-21, 21-15, 17-21 to Japan’s world No. 24 Hiroki Midorikawa-Natsu Saito.
