World No 2 Zii Jia was ambushed in his backyard by a Japanese. And the fellow was not the great Kento Momota. Remember his name - Kodai Naraoka. He stunned Zii Jia 13-21, 21-17, 21-19.

"Of course I'm disappointed, but I've given my all on court today. I have to accept the result," lamented Zii Jia in his post-match interview.

"I still need to improve when it comes to managing the draught (at the stadium). The conditions suited Naraoka better, he was also more patient," added Zii Jia.
Somehow, there have been too many banana skins in Zii Jia's home tournament - the Malaysia Open. Since his debut in 2019, he has never made it past the second round.


This means that the much anticipated all-Malaysian second round clash between Zii Jia and national No 1 Ng Tze Yong will never happen.
Instead, it will be Tze Yong who takes on Naraoka in the next round tomorrow for a place in the quarter-finals.
