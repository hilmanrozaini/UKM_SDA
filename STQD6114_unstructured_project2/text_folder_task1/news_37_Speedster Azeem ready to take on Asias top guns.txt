Speedster Azeem ready to take on Asia's top guns

KUALA LUMPUR: Azeem Fahmi, who is now ranked among the top 10 men's 100m sprinters in Asia, can contend for a medal in the Asian Athletics Championships in Pattaya from July 12-16.

Azeem, a student of the Auburn State University in Alabama, the United States, has run a blistering 10.04s at the NCAA Division 1 East Track and Field Championships in Jacksonville, Florida, last month to finish sixth.

It was his personal best, but the time was deemed as wind-assisted, so the national record of 10.09 set by Azeem himself still stands.

That said, 10.04s was the fastest time clocked by an Asian in recent months, and has put Azeem among the contenders for a podium finish in Pattaya.
The 19-year-old from Perak looks capable of taking on the speedsters from Japan, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, China and Middle Eastern countries in the Asian meet.
China's Su Bingtian, who holds the Asian record of 9.83 (registered at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021), will not be competing due to injuries.
Azeem is expected to line up against Japan's Abdel Karim Sani Brown, Ryuichiro Sakai and Hiroyoki Yanagata, Sri Lankan Yupun Abeykoon, Taiwanese Chun Han Yang, China's Zhenye Xie and Qatar's Femi Ogunode.

Azeem's coach Amir Izwan said he is excited to run against Asia's top sprinters in Pattaya.

"He should be in good shape to compete against the top sprinters from Asia. The meet is important to see where he stands among them. If he can maintain the same time (10.04s) in the Asian championships, he stands a chance to be on the podium.

"The Asian meet is part of Azeem's preparation for the Asian Games (in Hangzhou in September)."
