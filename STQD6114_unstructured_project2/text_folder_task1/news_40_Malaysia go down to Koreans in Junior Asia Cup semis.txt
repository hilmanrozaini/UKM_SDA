Malaysia go down to Koreans in Junior Asia Cup semis

KUALA LUMPUR: The Malaysian women's hockey team ended their Junior Asia Cup campaign on a sad note in Kakamigahara, Japan, today.

They were bundled out of the semi-finals 3-1 by South Korea.

Playing in Group A, Korea only needed a draw while Malaysia had to get a win to make the last four.

But a fourth minute Korean penalty corner goal saw coach Lailin Abu Hassan's charges playing a chasing game for the next 54 minutes.
An Sujin (fourth) and Song Sungeun's (38th) penalty corner strokes made it a mountain to climb for Malaysia who tried gallantly, and managed to pull one back through Norshafiqha Ishak in the 38th minute.


But Lee Yu Jin (48th) nailed the semis door shut, and now Malaysia will play in the fifth-eighth classification matches. Malaysia will meet Hong Kong tomorrow.
South Korea will play China while India meet Japan in the semi-finals to decide the three medallists who will qualify for the Chile Junior World Cup at the end of the year.

"There was a momentary lapse during the fourth minute penalty corner and we were punished for it by a deflected goal. After that we had to keep chasing for the equaliser but my charges gave their best," said Lailin.
